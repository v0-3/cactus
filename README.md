# Cactus

**Cactus** is a utility designed to automate attempts to claim League of Legends summoner names.  
The original version is now available under **[Cactus 1.0](https://github.com/v0-3/cactus/tree/master/cactus-1.0)**.

## Overview

Cactus supports two operation modes:

### 1. Turbo Mode
Continuously attempts to change your summoner name to the requested one.  
Runs 24/7 until the operation either succeeds or is manually stopped.

### 2. Sniper Mode
Attempts to change your summoner name precisely at the predicted expiration time.  
To determine a name’s expiration date, visit **[lolnames.gg](https://lolnames.gg/en/)**.

If you have questions or concerns, feel free to contact me here or on **Discord: `v0.3`**.
